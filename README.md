## File Structure

```
chessbot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js            # Game logic and UI management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chessrules.js      # Chess rules engine and move generation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ engines.js         # AI engine implementations

```

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. **Choose Players**: Select Human or AI for white and black
3. **Make Moves**: Click piece, then click destination
4. **Special Moves**: 
   - Castling: Move king two squares toward rook
   - En Passant: Automatic when conditions are met
   - Promotion: Choose piece when pawn reaches end rank
5. **Game Control**: Use pause/resume and navigation buttons as needed

## AI Engine Architecture

The chess engine system is modular and extensible:

### Base Engine Class
```javascript
class ChessEngine {
  async getMove(gameState, color, timeLimit)
  onActivate() / onDeactivate()
  getSettings()
}
```

### Adding New Engines
1. Extend the `ChessEngine` class
2. Implement the `getMove` method
3. Register with `engineRegistry.registerEngine()`

### Engine Registry
- Manages active engines for each color
- Handles engine switching and time limits
- Provides consistent interface for game logic

## Technical Implementation

### Game State Management
- Immutable game state with copy-on-write
- Complete position tracking for repetition detection
- Efficient move generation and validation

### Move Representation
```javascript
class ChessMove {
  from: {row, col}
  to: {row, col}
  piece: string
  moveType: 'normal'|'castle'|'enpassant'|'promotion'
  promotionPiece?: string
  capturedPiece?: string
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Alpha-beta pruning in minimax search
- Efficient board representation
- Lazy move generation
- Time-limited AI thinking

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- No external dependencies
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- **Advanced Engines**: 
  - Opening book support
  - Endgame tablebase integration
  - Neural network evaluation
- **Game Features**:
  - PGN import/export
  - Position setup (FEN)
  - Analysis mode with best move suggestions
- **UI Improvements**:
  - Board themes and piece sets
  - Sound effects
  - Mobile touch controls
- **Multiplayer**:
  - Online play with WebSockets
  - Tournament mode
  - Rating system

### Engine Development
The modular engine architecture makes it easy to add sophisticated chess engines:
- Implement evaluation functions
- Add opening books
- Create specialized endgame engines
- Experiment with machine learning approaches

## Contributing

The codebase is designed for extensibility:
1. Chess rules are separated from UI logic
2. Engine interface allows easy AI development
3. Game state is immutable for reliable testing
4. Clear separation of concerns throughout

Feel free to extend the engine collection or enhance the user interface!
